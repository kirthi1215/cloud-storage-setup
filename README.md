# DESCRIPTION OF TASK  

In this project, I worked on **Cloud Computing** under the internship at Codtech IT Solutions. My primary task was to set up a cloud storage system using **Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage**. The aim of the task was to understand how to create, configure, and manage a storage bucket in a real-world cloud storage environment.  

Cloud storage plays a vital role in today’s IT infrastructure by providing scalable, secure, and reliable storage solutions over the internet. Backblaze B2 is one of the cost-effective cloud storage platforms, offering object storage similar to Amazon S3. Through this task, I learned the essential steps involved in creating and using a bucket in Backblaze.  

The first step was to create an account on Backblaze. After logging in, I navigated to the **B2 Cloud Storage** dashboard. From there, I selected the option to create a new bucket. A **bucket** in cloud storage is like a container where all files (objects) are stored. While creating the bucket, I provided a bucket name and selected the type of bucket – either **private** (for restricted access) or **public** (for open access). Choosing the right access type is important based on the project requirement. For my setup, I created a bucket named **My-Cloud-Bucket** and set it as private to ensure data security.  

Once the bucket was created, the next step was uploading files into it. Backblaze provides a very user-friendly interface for uploading files. I used the “Upload” button to add files such as test images and documents. Each file that gets uploaded is stored as an object in the bucket and is given a unique file ID. The platform also displays details like file size, upload date, and path.  

In addition to the web interface, Backblaze supports **command-line operations** and API integration. For this, I installed **Git Bash** on my laptop to practice using CLI commands. Using the Backblaze application keys (key ID and application key), I could authenticate my access and perform actions like uploading and downloading files via command line. This helped me understand how developers automate cloud storage operations in real-world projects.  

Another key feature I explored was **snapshot management** and **lifecycle rules**. Snapshots allow you to capture the state of your storage at a given time, while lifecycle rules help manage storage costs by automatically deleting or moving older files. This feature ensures that the cloud bucket is not only scalable but also cost-efficient.  

During this project, I also learned about the importance of **data security** in cloud environments. Backblaze provides encryption and secure transfer options so that files are not exposed to unauthorized access. I understood how access control is implemented with the help of application keys and bucket-level permissions.  

Overall, this project gave me hands-on exposure to setting up cloud storage, managing objects, and understanding the key concepts of **cloud computing**. I realized how important cloud storage is for businesses today, as it helps them store, manage, and share data with high reliability and availability. Working on this task also improved my practical knowledge of cloud service providers, and I gained confidence in managing cloud resources through both graphical interfaces and command-line tools.  

The process I followed can be summarized as:  
1. Sign up and log in to Backblaze.  
2. Navigate to **B2 Cloud Storage**.  
3. Create a new bucket (with name and access type).  
4. Upload files to the bucket.  
5. Use Git Bash/CLI for authentication and operations.  
6. Explore snapshots, lifecycle rules, and permissions.  
7. Verify uploaded files and ensure accessibility.  

This task was an excellent opportunity to apply my cloud computing knowledge to a real storage platform. It gave me practical insights into how cloud storage works, and it will definitely help me in my future projects and career in cloud computing.
